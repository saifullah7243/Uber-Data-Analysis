**Python Project: Uber Ride Data Analysis**

This project uses Python for analyzing Uber ride data to gain insights into customer behavior and booking trends. The dataset contains information such as ride categories, purposes, dates, times, distances, and more. The analysis aims to answer business questions and derive actionable insights through data visualization and exploration.

## **Project Objectives**
1. Identify the most common categories and purposes for Uber rides.
2. Analyze booking trends based on time of day, day of the week, and month.
3. Explore distance patterns to understand the typical ride lengths.
4. Visualize findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better interpretation.

## **Data Preprocessing**
- **Loading the Dataset**:
  - Imported the dataset using `pandas` and inspected the first few rows and column names.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Converted `start_date` and `end_date` to datetime format using `pd.to_datetime`.
  - Filled missing values in the `purpose` column with "Other."
  - Dropped rows with remaining missing values after ensuring critical data fields were retained.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new columns like `date`, `time`, `day_night`, `month`, and `day` from the `start_date` column.
  - Categorized booking times into `Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`, and `Night` using bins.

## **Key Questions and Insights**

### **1. Which category is the most popular for Uber rides?**
- **Analysis**: 
  - Used `value_counts()` on the `category` column to find the most frequent booking category.
- **Finding**: 
  - The **Business** category dominates with 407 rides, while the **Personal** category accounts for only 13 rides.
- **Visualization**:
  - Created a count plot using `sns.countplot()` for clear representation.

### **2. What is the most common purpose for Uber rides?**
- **Analysis**: 
  - Aggregated data from the `purpose` column using `value_counts()`.
- **Finding**:
  - The top purposes include **Meetings**, **Meal/Entertainment**, and **Errands/Supplies**, with "Other" representing undefined purposes.
- **Visualization**:
  - Plotted a count plot of the `purpose` column for better understanding.

### **3. At what time do people book Uber rides the most?**
- **Analysis**:
  - Categorized rides into time bins (`Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`, `Night`) using the `cut` method.
- **Finding**:
  - **Evening** is the most popular time for Uber bookings, followed by **Afternoon**.
  - **Morning** has the least number of bookings.
- **Visualization**:
  - Visualized the distribution using a bar plot.

---

### **4. In which months do people book Uber rides less frequently?**
- **Analysis**:
  - Extracted months from the `start_date` column and mapped them to month names.
  - Calculated monthly booking frequencies using `value_counts()`.
- **Finding**:
  - **September** has the least number of bookings, while **November** sees the highest.
- **Visualization**:
  - Combined line and bar plots to show monthly trends and maximum miles per month.

---

### **5. On which days of the week do people book Uber rides the most?**
- **Analysis**:
  - Mapped weekdays to names using the `weekday` method and calculated booking frequencies.
- **Finding**:
  - **Friday** is the most popular day for bookings, followed by weekdays like **Monday** and **Thursday**.
  - **Sunday** is the least popular day.
- **Visualization**:
  - Created a bar plot and line plot for weekly trends.

---

### **6. How many miles do people usually book a cab for through Uber?**
- **Analysis**:
  - Used a histogram to analyze the distribution of the `miles` column.
- **Finding**:
  - Most rides are short, ranging between **0 to 10 miles**, indicating local commutes or errands.
  - A smaller percentage of rides cover medium to long distances (10â€“20 miles or more).
- **Visualization**:
  - Plotted a histogram with KDE for a detailed view.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Booking Category**: Business rides dominate the dataset.
- **Primary Purpose**: Meetings are the most frequent purpose, aside from undefined "Other" bookings.
- **Popular Times**: Evening is the peak booking time.
- **Low-Booking Month**: September sees the fewest bookings, while November has the highest.
- **Top Weekday**: Friday is the busiest day for bookings.
- **Ride Distance**: The majority of rides are under 10 miles, highlighting their short-distance nature.
